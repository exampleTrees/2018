</p>
<p>
    This breakthrough is SO stunning, we currently keep this special offer
    closed to the public – it’s ONLY available to our most elite subscribers.

  <!--====  Start Body Section  ====-->

  <p style="margin-top: 50px">Hello, I&rsquo;m Greg Guenthner.</p>

  <p>As you know, I manage the Trading Research Desk here at Seven Figure Publishing in Baltimore, Maryland&hellip;</p>

  <p>And I&rsquo;m reaching out to you today with life-changing news.</p>

  <p>It&rsquo;s &ldquo;life-changing&rdquo; because what I&rsquo;m about to reveal could literally <em>give you a life of obscene wealth </em>&mdash; starting immediately.</p>

  <p>And it&rsquo;s &ldquo;news&rdquo; because outside of just six key people within our company&hellip;</p>

  <h3>No one has <u>ever seen</u> this personal<br class="hidebr" />
  wealth game-changer</h3>

  <p>We&rsquo;ve spent the last five years developing this incredible breakthrough&hellip;</p>

  <p>But this bulletin, right here, is the very first time we&rsquo;ve ever unveiled it to anyone outside our own inner circle.</p>

  <p>What you&rsquo;re about to see is a<em> whole new way to make money in the stock market</em>&hellip;</p>

  <p>A way that&rsquo;s <em>totally invisible</em> to Wall Street, the hedge funds &mdash; everyone but us.</p>

  <p>And as we go along, I&rsquo;ll show you everything you need to know about it&hellip;</p>

  <ul class="checkmark">
  	<li>
  	<p>How it<strong> predicts stock price moves 365 days in the future</strong></p>
  	</li>
  	<li>
  	<p>How it&rsquo;s<strong> picked winning stocks with 93.5% accuracy since 2009 </strong></p>
  	</li>
  	<li>
  	<p>How it could&rsquo;ve shown you<strong> dozens of wins per year up to 2,705% each</strong></p>
  	</li>
  	<li>
  	<p>And how it could be <strong>changing your life less than 24 hours from now</strong></p>
  	</li>
  </ul>

  <p>But before I do all that, I need to show you <em>what this thing can do for you&hellip;</em></p>

  <p>Because that&rsquo;s the truly &ldquo;life-changing&rdquo; part.</p>

  <h3>Introducing the &ldquo;K Sign&rdquo; &mdash;<br class="hidebr" />
  an all-new <u>extreme profit indicator</u> Wall Street would no doubt STEAL if they could</h3>

  <p>Let me start with a question, intended only to help you decide if this is right for you.</p>

  <p>If you could have <em>either</em> a million dollars cash&hellip;</p>


  <div class="row">
  <div class="medium-6 medium-push-6 columns"><img alt="Briefcase of Cash" class="image_center" src="https://d13p2xj50zkyqm.cloudfront.net/promos/AF/PMT/K_Sign_0617/PMT_KSign_MoneyBriefcase.jpg
  " /></div>

  <div class="medium-6 medium-pull-6 columns">
  <p style="margin-top: 0px">Or the power to know &mdash; far into the future &mdash; exactly when to buy and sell stocks for the <em>biggest returns</em>&hellip;</p>

  <p>Which one would you pick?</p>

  <p>If you&rsquo;d take the million bucks, the wealth breakthrough I&rsquo;m about to reveal may not be your thing.</p>

  <p>However, if you&rsquo;d rather have the <em>millions more</em> you could rake in by <strong>winning over 93% of the stock trades you make from now on</strong>&hellip;</p>
  </div>
  </div>

  <div class="row small-12 column">
  <p style="margin-top: 0px">And the chance to score extraordinary profits of <strong>up to 27 times your money on every single trade</strong>&hellip;</p>

  <p>Then stay with me here &mdash; because that&rsquo;s the kind of life-changing wealth our new K Sign Indicator could make you.</p>

  <p>How could this thing possibly be so accurate, you&rsquo;re wondering?</p>

  <p>It&rsquo;s possible because the K Sign Indicator is <u>generated by computer algorithm</u>.</p>

  <p>That fact allows us to prove its predictive power using <em>market data from the past</em>.</p>

  <p>How can we say the algorithm &ldquo;predicted&rdquo; market wins that have already happened?</p>

  <p>It&rsquo;s because computers <u>make no distinction between past data and real-time data</u>.</p>

  <p>So &ldquo;predicting&rdquo; a trade that occurred in the past is simply a matter of giving the algorithm the right starting date and data set to crunch.</p>

  <p>Remember, our new K Sign Indicator has NEVER been traded by anyone before&hellip;</p>

  <p>So every trade example you&rsquo;ll see in this bulletin came from the algorithm&rsquo;s analysis of past data &mdash; which is sometimes called &ldquo;back testing.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>That fact doesn&rsquo;t make the algorithm&rsquo;s 93.5% accuracy rate any less valid&hellip;</p>

  <p>Does it mean we&rsquo;re guaranteeing that you&rsquo;ll never see a losing trade &mdash; or that you&rsquo;ll score 2,000% gains on every trade in real time?</p>

  <p>Of course not.</p>

  <p>What we ARE guaranteeing is that you&rsquo;ll never see a more powerful short-term profit strategy than our new K Sign Indicator&hellip;</p>

  <p>To begin proving that, let&rsquo;s take a look at this chart for metals company Vale, SA:</p>
  <img alt="Vale, SA" class="image_center" src="https://d13p2xj50zkyqm.cloudfront.net/promos/AF/PMT/K_Sign_0617/PMT_KSign_Chart_002.png" />
  <p>In hindsight, it&rsquo;s easy to see that for the biggest returns, you&rsquo;d have wanted to get in around New Year&rsquo;s Day&hellip;</p>

  <p>And get out sometime in the middle of February of this year.</p>
  <img alt="Vale, SA" class="image_center" src="https://d13p2xj50zkyqm.cloudfront.net/promos/AF/PMT/K_Sign_0617/PMT_KSign_Chart_003.png" />
  <p>However, the simple truth is that <em>no trading tool or system currently in use&hellip;</em></p>

  <p>Not even the high-tech platforms at Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, J.P. Morgan Chase, or any other firm on Wall Street&hellip;</p>

  <p>Could&rsquo;ve accurately predicted these ideal &ldquo;buy&rdquo; and &ldquo;sell&rdquo; windows very far in advance &mdash; if at all.</p>

  <p>But our new, never-before-seen K Sign Indicator <strong>nailed both ends of this trade almost perfectly </strong>in historical data testing...</p>

  <p>And it did it literally <em>a year in advance</em>.</p>

  <p>Just check out the two lines that make up this indicator (I&rsquo;ll explain them shortly)&hellip;</p>

  <p>See how they converge on almost the exact high and low points of this trade?</p>
  <img alt="Vale, SA" class="image_center" src="https://d13p2xj50zkyqm.cloudfront.net/promos/AF/PMT/K_Sign_0617/PMT_KSign_Chart_004.png" />
  <p>Now look a little closer: Can you see how the lines form a &ldquo;K&rdquo; shape at those points?</p>

  <p>Here, I&rsquo;ll fade the price chart back. Do you see them now?</p>
  <img alt="Vale, SA" class="image_center" src="https://d13p2xj50zkyqm.cloudfront.net/promos/AF/PMT/K_Sign_0617/PMT_KSign_Chart_005.png" />
  <p>Those are the K Signs, right there.</p>

  <p>The &ldquo;buy&rdquo; sign always looks like a letter K that&rsquo;s been <em>tipped over on its back</em>&hellip;</p>
  <img alt="Vale, SA" class="image_center" src="https://d13p2xj50zkyqm.cloudfront.net/promos/AF/PMT/K_Sign_0617/PMT_KSign_Chart_006.png" />
  <p>While the &ldquo;sell&rdquo; sign always looks like a K that&rsquo;s <em>fallen forward</em>.</p>

  <p>This makes it super-simple to get rich using the K Sign Indicator.</p>

  <p>Working together, these two distinctive signals can show you when to both buy AND sell for huge profits!</p>

  <p>The proof that it works is right there in the chart&hellip;</p>

  <p>As you can see, the K Signs materialized at <u>almost the perfect moments</u> to cash in on this big price move in Vale, SA, shares.</p>
  <img alt="Vale, SA" class="image_center" src="https://d13p2xj50zkyqm.cloudfront.net/promos/AF/PMT/K_Sign_0617/PMT_KSign_Chart_007.png" />
  <p>One signaled the &ldquo;buy&rdquo; on January 1st (the next trading day was the 3rd)&hellip;</p>

  <p>The other signaled the &ldquo;sell&rdquo; on February 16th.</p>

  <p>And if you&rsquo;d simply bought and sold on these K Sign dates&hellip;</p>

  <p>You could&rsquo;ve scored returns of <strong>667% in under 47 days</strong> on this trade.</p>
  <img alt="NRG Energy Inc." class="image_center" src="https://d13p2xj50zkyqm.cloudfront.net/promos/AF/PMT/K_Sign_0617/PMT_KSign_Chart_008.png" />
  <p>The crazy part is, our new K Sign Indicator signaled these dates in the historical data <u>precisely 365 days ahead of time</u>!</p>

  <p>It happened the same way with an integrated power company called NRG Energy.</p>
  <img alt="NRG Energy Inc." class="image_center" src="https://d13p2xj50zkyqm.cloudfront.net/promos/AF/PMT/K_Sign_0617/PMT_KSign_Chart_009.png" />
  <p>Here&rsquo;s what the indicator predicted in the past data for this stock from mid-October of last year through the end of February&hellip;</p>

  <p>Can you see the K Signs in the two lines?</p>
  <img alt="NRG Energy Inc." class="image_center" src="https://d13p2xj50zkyqm.cloudfront.net/promos/AF/PMT/K_Sign_0617/PMT_KSign_Chart_010.png" />
  <p>There&rsquo;s the &ldquo;buy&rdquo; sign right there on November 20th&hellip;</p>

  <p>You can see the &ldquo;sell&rdquo; sign over on February 3rd.</p>

  <p>Once more, we see that these K Signs could&rsquo;ve gotten you in close to the lowest point of this big price move&hellip;</p>

  <p>And also could&rsquo;ve cashed you out at <em>very nearly its highest peak</em>.</p>
  <img alt="NRG Energy Inc." class="image_center" src="https://d13p2xj50zkyqm.cloudfront.net/promos/AF/PMT/K_Sign_0617/PMT_KSign_Chart_011.png" />
  <p>And just like with the earlier VALE example&hellip;</p>

  <p>Our breakthrough indicator flagged both of these trading dates in the back-test data exactly <u>a year before their corresponding K Signs appeared</u>.</p>

  <p>How can we predict these price moves so far in advance, you&rsquo;re wondering?</p>

  <p>This bulletin, right here, explains it all. But before we get into those details&hellip;</p>

  <p>I want to make sure you understand <em>this one thing</em>:</p>

  <p>If you can spare 10 minutes a month to trade on the K Sign dates our new indicator reveals&hellip;.</p>

  <p>You could get extremely rich, extremely fast.</p>

  <p>Case in point &mdash; if you&rsquo;d bought in and cashed out on these indicated K Sign dates for NRG Energy, Inc&hellip;</p>

  <p>You&rsquo;d have scored incredible returns of <strong>1,800% in less than 75 days </strong>on this trade.</p>

  <p>That&rsquo;s another way of saying you&rsquo;d have made <u>18 times your money in pure profit</u>&hellip;</p>

  <p><em>In less than 2&frac12; months!</em></p>
  <img alt="NRG Energy Inc." class="image_center" src="https://d13p2xj50zkyqm.cloudfront.net/promos/AF/PMT/K_Sign_0617/PMT_KSign_Chart_012.png" />
  <p>Let me show you just one more recent example to hammer this point home&hellip;</p>

  <p>It&rsquo;s a mining company called NovaGold Resources.</p>
  <img alt="NovaGold Resources" class="image_center" src="https://d13p2xj50zkyqm.cloudfront.net/promos/AF/PMT/K_Sign_0617/PMT_KSign_Chart_013.png" />
  <p>Here&rsquo;s what the K Sign Indicator&rsquo;s past data analysis predicted would happen with this stock from early November to mid-March.</p>

  <p>As you can see, the &ldquo;buy&rdquo; sign caught the <em>exact bottom</em> of the move, December 17th&hellip;</p>
  <img alt="NovaGold Resources" class="image_center" src="https://d13p2xj50zkyqm.cloudfront.net/promos/AF/PMT/K_Sign_0617/PMT_KSign_Chart_014.png" />
  <p>While the February 16th &ldquo;sell&rdquo; sign only missed the peak by <em>one day!</em></p>

  <p>And yes &mdash; just like in the other examples&hellip;</p>

  <p>Our K Sign Indicator pegged both of these trading dates in the data exactly <em>365 days in advance</em>.</p>

  <p>Not to keep rubbing your nose in it&hellip;</p>

  <p>But if you&rsquo;d had the awesome predictive power of our new indicator in your corner on this trade&hellip;</p>
  <img alt="NovaGold Resources" class="image_center" src="https://d13p2xj50zkyqm.cloudfront.net/promos/AF/PMT/K_Sign_0617/PMT_KSign_Chart_015.png" />
  <p>You could&rsquo;ve scored <strong>1,110% returns in under 60 days</strong>&hellip;</p>

  <p>Again, that&rsquo;s by simply trading on the K Sign dates our new indicator shows you.</p>
  <img alt="NovaGold Resources" class="image_center" src="https://d13p2xj50zkyqm.cloudfront.net/promos/AF/PMT/K_Sign_0617/PMT_KSign_Chart_016.png" />
  <p>In dollar terms, that means you could&rsquo;ve scored <em>$111,000 in pure profit&hellip;</em></p>

  <p>For every 10 grand you invested!</p>

  <p>A $25,000 trade would&rsquo;ve roped you $277,500 in profits&hellip;</p>

  <p>A starting stake of 50 grand would&rsquo;ve put an unreal $555,000 in your pocket&hellip;</p>

  <p>And all of it in less than two months &mdash; on just this <em>one trade alone!</em></p>

  <p>Incredible, isn&rsquo;t it?</p>

  <p>Now are you starting to see what I mean when I say our new K Sign Indicator is a potential<em> life-changer </em>for you?</p>

  <p>And just think &mdash; you&rsquo;ve only seen three K Sign trade examples so far&hellip;</p>

  <p>For &ldquo;only&rdquo; 3,576% in combined profit potential over less than three months in the early part of this year.</p>

  <p>But that&rsquo;s just a tiny snapshot of what this breakthrough could do for you.</p>

  <p>Wait &rsquo;til I show you how much the K Sign Indicator could&rsquo;ve made you in all of calendar year 2016.</p>

  <p>I&rsquo;m talking <strong>over $2 million</strong> on just <em>two trades a month...</em></p>
  <img alt="$2 Million Trades a Month" class="image_center" src="https://d13p2xj50zkyqm.cloudfront.net/promos/AF/PMT/K_Sign_0617/PMT_KSign_Chart_017.png" />
  <p style="margin-top: 0px">With stunning single-trade returns as high as:</p>

  <ul class="checkmark">
  	<li>
  	<p>1,006% in 35 days</p>
  	</li>
  	<li>
  	<p>1,269% in 76 days</p>
  	</li>
  	<li>
  	<p>1,937% in 56 days</p>
  	</li>
  	<li>
  	<p>2,040% in 155 days&hellip;</p>
  	</li>
  	<li>
  	<p>Even as much as <strong><em>2,705% in 150 days!</em></strong></p>
  	</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Yes, you&rsquo;ll see the mathematical proof of all that shortly.</p>

  <p>And <em>when</em> you see it&hellip;</p>

  <p>You&rsquo;ll understand why I truly believe Wall Street would steal this breakthrough from us if they could.</p>

  <p>Because as I touched on earlier&hellip;</p>

  <p>Nothing they have is even remotely close to being 93.5% accurate at picking big stock-market wins a <em>single day </em>in advance&hellip;</p>

  <p><em>Much less 365 days into the future!</em></p>

  <p>I&rsquo;m not exaggerating when I say that this is the<strong> most significant moneymaking breakthrough anyone at Seven Figure Publishing has ever seen</strong>.</p>

  <p>Now, again, I want to remind you that all of these trade examples I&rsquo;m showing you in this bulletin are <em>theoretical</em>.</p>

  <p>We&rsquo;re not guaranteeing you&rsquo;ll never see a losing trade with the K Sign Indicator&hellip;</p>

  <p>Or that you&rsquo;ll score 20 times your money on every single trade.</p>

  <p>Those kinds of wins, in real life, would be exceptional returns &mdash; not typical returns.</p>

  <p>However, what I can guarantee is that as a 15-year veteran trader myself&hellip;</p>

  <p>I&rsquo;ve never seen ANY other method of trading that&rsquo;s <em>even remotely</em> as profitable or accurate as I believe the K Sign Indicator to be.</p>

  <p>I can also say with absolute certainty that our new K Sign Indictor is unlike anything else currently in use&hellip;</p>

  <p>Or that&rsquo;s ever BEEN used before &mdash; by anyone.</p>

  <p>It employs mathematical theory that has never been applied to trading before&hellip;</p>

  <p>And it&rsquo;s driven by algorithmic supercomputing technology that <em>no one else in the world</em> has ever developed.</p>

  <p>So unless someone succeeds in actually, physically stealing it from us&hellip;</p>

  <p>And we&rsquo;ve put security measures in place to make sure that <em>can&rsquo;t happen</em>&hellip;</p>

  <p>The K Sign Indicator will remain invisible to everyone but us.</p>

  <p>But when I say &ldquo;us&rdquo; &mdash; that could include YOU.</p>

  <p>I&rsquo;ll show you how in just a moment.</p>

  <p>First, though, I want to show you the proof behind all these bold claims I&rsquo;ve made.</p>

  <p>And <em>that</em> onion has a number of layers, so to speak.</p>

  <p>The first one is&hellip;</p>

  <h3>Kinetic Profit Windows: Trading the<br class="hidebr" />
  <u>hidden forces that move certain stocks</u>&mdash;<br class="hidebr" />
  for wins of up to <em>2,705% </em></h3>

  <p>Obviously, one reason we call our new breakthrough the K Sign Indicator&hellip;</p>

  <p>Is the way the two lines that form it on a chart resemble the letter K at the &ldquo;buy&rdquo; and &ldquo;sell&rdquo; moments.</p>
  <img alt="Vale, SA" class="image_center" src="https://d13p2xj50zkyqm.cloudfront.net/promos/AF/PMT/K_Sign_0617/PMT_KSign_Chart_005.png" />
  <p>But there&rsquo;s another reason we call it that&hellip;</p>

  <p>One that&rsquo;s <em>far more important</em> to how this new indicator could make you rich.</p>

  <p>It&rsquo;s because &ldquo;K&rdquo; is the first letter of the word &ldquo;Kinetic&rdquo; &mdash; which means <em>motion</em>.</p>

  <p>And as you&rsquo;ve just seen, that&rsquo;s what the indicator predicts&hellip;</p>
  <img alt="NovaGold Resources" class="image_center" src="https://d13p2xj50zkyqm.cloudfront.net/promos/AF/PMT/K_Sign_0617/PMT_KSign_Chart_018.png" />
  <p><strong>Future upward motion in a stock&rsquo;s price. </strong></p>

  <p>In other words: Big, fast profit opportunities for traders who can see these K Signs.</p>

  <p>Now I want to show you how the K Sign Indicator can <u>predict these wins 93.5% of the time</u> in certain stocks&hellip;</p>

  <p>And why it predicts them <u>precisely 365 days in advance</u>, every single time.</p>

  <p>That all starts by introducing you to something called a &ldquo;Kinetic Profit Window.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Now don&rsquo;t bother to Google that &mdash; it&rsquo;s our own proprietary term.</p>

  <p>It refers to a window of time in which a stock&rsquo;s price is <strong>statistically predisposed to move sharply upward&hellip;</strong></p>

  <p>In reaction to hidden or unexplained market forces.</p>

  <p>To start showing you exactly what I mean by that&hellip;</p>

  <p>Let&rsquo;s equate it to a few things you&rsquo;re already familiar with.</p>

  <p>Like gravity, for instance.</p>

  <p>Did you know that scientists still do not fully understand gravitational force?</p>

  <p>In fact, they&rsquo;re actually not even <em>close</em> to understanding it.</p>

  <div class="wistia_responsive_wrapper" style="max-height:360px;max-width:640px; margin:0 auto; margin-bottom: 2em; -webkit-box-shadow: 0px 0px 26px 0px rgba(50, 50, 50, 1);-moz-box-shadow: 0px 0px 26px 0px rgba(50, 50, 50, 1);box-shadow: 0px 0px 26px 0px rgba(50, 50, 50, 1);">

  </div>

  <p>Same deal with magnetism.</p>

  <p>Science <em>does not know</em> for certain what magnetic force is&hellip;</p>

  <p>Or exactly why magnets do what they do.</p>

  <p>Another force nobody&rsquo;s truly figured yet out is <em>lift</em>.</p>

  <p>Ever since the Wright brothers first took flight in 1903&hellip;</p>

  <p>The way airplane wings actually work has been a source of more or less constant debate.</p>

  <p>The point is that gravity, magnetism, and lift are all unseen forces&hellip;</p>

  <p>That are not well understood&hellip;</p>

  <p>Yet are extremely reliable at <em>creating motion</em>.</p>

  <p>As I&rsquo;m about to prove, it&rsquo;s <strong>exactly the same with certain stocks.</strong></p>

  <p>Within this pool of stocks &mdash; which I&rsquo;ll tell you more about in a moment&hellip;</p>

  <p>Hidden market forces that are poorly understood&hellip;</p>

  <p>Create <em>short periods of upward price motion </em>with remarkable reliability.</p>

  <p>We call these lucrative upticks Kinetic Profit Windows&hellip;</p>

  <p>Because they can lead you to BIG profits in a very small amount of time.</p>

  <p>As you may have figured out, the &ldquo;buy&rdquo; and &ldquo;sell&rdquo; K Signs I&rsquo;ve been showing you&hellip;</p>

  <p><u>Mark the starting and ending dates of these Kinetic Profit Windows</u>.</p>

  <p>That&rsquo;s why it&rsquo;s <em>so incredibly easy</em> to make money from our new K Sign Indicator.</p>

  <p>Again, you just trade on the K Sign dates&hellip;</p>

  <p>Then cruise to the beach in your new Maserati.</p>

  <p>I&rsquo;m not even kidding about that part, either.</p>

  <p>Like I showed you earlier in this NRG Energy example &mdash; and the others&hellip;</p>
  <img alt="NRG Energy Inc." class="image_center" src="https://d13p2xj50zkyqm.cloudfront.net/promos/AF/PMT/K_Sign_0617/PMT_KSign_Chart_012.png" />
  <p>Predicting exactly when these Kinetic Profit Windows were coming ahead of time&hellip;</p>

  <p>Could&rsquo;ve scored you several HUGE wins of up to <em>1,800% already this year!</em></p>

  <p>Think about that &mdash; a mere 10 grand in this <em>one trade alone</em> could&rsquo;ve cleared you $<strong>180,000 in pure profit</strong>.</p>

  <div class="row small-12 column">
  <p style="margin-top: 0px">Once again, they&rsquo;re short periods of time in which a stock&rsquo;s price is <strong>statistically predisposed to go up</strong>&hellip;</p>

  <p>The one that could <em>change your life with obscene wealth</em>.</p>

  <h3>These lucrative &ldquo;Windows&rdquo; occur in a<br class="hidebr" />
  repeating rhythm that could score you<br class="hidebr" />
  $166,800 a month &mdash; or more!</h3>

  <p>OK, now this is where things start to get a little tricky&hellip;</p>

  <p>You see, I want to show you exactly how we can predict the Kinetic Profit Windows that could make you so incredibly rich&hellip;</p>

  <p>But I&rsquo;ve got to be very careful about how I do that.</p>

  <p>If I go TOO deep into those nuts and bolts in a public forum like this&hellip;</p>
  </div>

  <div class="row">
  <div class="medium-6 medium-push-6 columns"><img alt="Wall Street" class="image_center" src="https://d13p2xj50zkyqm.cloudfront.net/promos/AF/PMT/K_Sign_0617/PMT_KSign_WallStreet.jpg" /></div>

  <div class="medium-6 medium-pull-6 columns">
  <p style="margin-top: 0px">It&rsquo;s possible that Wall Street could &ldquo;reverse engineer&rdquo; a version of the K Sign Indicator.</p>

  <p>That being said, however&hellip;</p>

  <p>I think I can still make the gumbo for you without giving away the secret recipe.</p>

  <p>You already know what the main ingredient is: Kinetic Profit Windows.</p>
  </div>
  </div>

  <div class="row small-12 column">
  <p style="margin-top: 0px">Now I&rsquo;m going to show you, in as much detail as I possibly can&hellip;</p>

  <p>How we can predict these lucrative price upticks 365 days into the future &mdash; and with 93.5% tested accuracy.</p>

  <p>I&rsquo;ll start with the basics&hellip;</p>

  <p>It takes three things for us to detect and document Kinetic Profit Windows:</p>

  <ol class="numbers">
  	<li>
  	<p><strong>An absolute genius</strong> quantitative analyst (you&rsquo;ll meet him in a moment)</p>
  	</li>
  	<li>
  	<p><strong>A predictive algorithm</strong> powerful enough to crunch billions of data points</p>
  	</li>
  	<li>
  	<p><strong>A supercomputer platform</strong> to process all the data this algorithm uses</p>
  	</li>
  </ol>

  <p>Of course, I&rsquo;ll go into more detail about these things shortly&hellip;</p>

  <p>But for now, just think of them as tools for proving a fairly simple proposition.</p>

  <p>That proposition: When you have enough market data from the past&hellip;</p>

  <p>And you can mathematically crunch and analyze that data the <em>right way</em></p>

  <p>You can find <u>lucrative ways of trading that have never been detected before</u>.</p>

  <p>We started out with that proposition five years ago &mdash; and have been rigorously testing it ever since.</p>

  <p>And when I say &ldquo;rigorously testing,&rdquo; I mean using a supercomputer to simulate <em>billions</em> of trades stretching as far back as 1974&hellip;</p>

  <p>With our own analytical algorithm that no one else in the world has access to.</p>

  <p>The thing is, all that data-crunching proved our proposition right&hellip;</p>

  <p>It revealed several <em>repeating mathematical anomalies</em> that have never been documented before.</p>

  <p>However, in terms of both statistical reliability AND explosive profit potential&hellip;</p>

  <p><strong>One of these cyclical anomalies was head and shoulders above all the others. </strong></p>

  <p>It&rsquo;s a repeating price &ldquo;rhythm&rdquo; that occurs only in a <em>very specific pool of 1,683 stocks</em>.</p>

  <p>In these particular stocks, between two and five short-term price upticks&hellip;</p>

  <p>Also known as Kinetic Profit Windows&hellip;</p>

  <p>Occur in the same time periods <em>every single year</em>, with remarkable regularity.</p>

  <p>In some cases, this yearly &ldquo;rhythm&rdquo; of upticks can be almost as reliable as gravity!</p>

  <p>For instance, one stock within this pool &mdash; Travelers Companies, Inc&hellip;</p>

  <p>Has historically displayed two Kinetic Profit Windows per year.</p>

  <p>And one of them has appeared at <em>the exact same time for 29 straight years!</em></p>

  <p>To be more specific &mdash; every year since 1988&hellip;</p>

  <p>This stock has gone up, to one degree or another, between the dates of August 28th and December 28th.</p>

  <p>Through booms, busts, crashes, recessions, Republicans, Democrats &mdash; you name it.</p>

  <p>V.F. Corporation is another good example of how reliable this price rhythm can be.</p>

  <p>This company shows three distinct Kinetic Profit Windows per year&hellip;</p>

  <p>But the one that occurs between January 26th and April 25th is the most reliable.</p>

  <p>During that particular &ldquo;Window&rdquo; of time, this stock has gone up in <em>29 out of the last 30 years!</em></p>

  <p>I could go on and on with examples like these. But the point is made&hellip;</p>

  <p>In certain stocks, there&rsquo;s a <em>very reliable rhythm</em> to the price motion in the past.</p>

  <p>And our unique ability to detect &mdash; and precisely quantify &mdash; this rhythm&hellip;</p>

  <p>Is what gives us the power to show you exactly when to trade these stocks for the biggest profit opportunities <em>in the future</em>.</p>

  <p>Simple, right?</p>

  <p>On your end, absolutely. It&rsquo;s easy as pie.</p>

  <p>If you know about these Kinetic Profit Windows&hellip;</p>

  <p>Then trade on the K Signs that mark them&hellip;</p>

  <p>You can rake in HUGE profits &mdash; with a degree of accuracy that&rsquo;s never been seen in the trading world before.</p>

  <p>And remember, I&rsquo;m going to <em>prove</em> that to you shortly&hellip;</p>

  <p>With 26 specific K Sign trades that could&rsquo;ve scored you <em>over $2 million</em> last year.</p>

  <p>That&rsquo;s an average of more than $166,800 a month &mdash; in just five minutes&rsquo; work, every other week!</p>

  <p>But before I take you through this stunning string of enormous data-proven wins&hellip;</p>

  <p>I want to explain some of the things you&rsquo;re surely wondering about, like:</p>

  <ul class="checkmark">
  	<li>The specific pool of 1,683 &ldquo;rhythmic&rdquo; stocks</li>
  	<li>The hidden forces that create a tradable rhythm in these stocks</li>
  	<li>The two lines that form the K Signs &mdash; and reveal exactly when to trade</li>
  	<li>How we can statistically prove that the K Sign Indicator is 93.5% accurate</li>
  </ul>

  <p>But perhaps more important than any of these things, I want to show you why&hellip;</p>

  <p><strong>No one has <u>ever detected</u> this incredibly lucrative &ldquo;rhythm&rdquo; </strong></p>

  <p><strong>in stock prices before (not even Wall Street&rsquo;s best)</strong></p>

  <p>That&rsquo;s not hype. It&rsquo;s a bona-fide fact&hellip;</p>

  <p>Right now, not even the most gifted &ldquo;quants&rdquo; on Wall Street know <em>anything about</em> the subtle cyclical rhythm in stock prices I just showed you.</p>

  <p>How is that possible, you&rsquo;re wondering?</p>

  <p>It&rsquo;s possible because of one man &mdash; one <em>genius</em>, actually&hellip;</p>

  <div class="medium-6 medium-pull-6 columns">
  <p style="margin-top:0px">His name is Jonas Elmerraji.</p>

  <p>Jonas has been our in-house quantitative analyst for <em>eight years</em>.</p>

  <p>He&rsquo;s also been a featured expert in <em>Forbes</em>, <em>Investor&rsquo;s Business Daily</em>, <em>CNBC</em>, and others.</p>

  <p>And if you study trading theory at all&hellip;</p>

  <p>I&rsquo;ll guarantee you&rsquo;ve read some of Jonas&rsquo; work on <em>Investopedia</em>, too.</p>
  </div>
  </div>

  <div class="row small-12 column">
  <p style="margin-top: 0px">Jonas is also a world-class trader in his own right&hellip;</p>

  <p>In fact, he currently scores in the top 3% of all professional traders featured on well-known performance ranking site <em>TipRanks.com</em>.</p>

  <p>The point is, Jonas Elmerraji has spent <em>years</em> analyzing the way Wall Street trades.</p>

  <p>And one of the most important things he discovered in this process&hellip;</p>

  <p>Is that their trading systems and algorithms are fundamentally designed to <em>correlate cause and effect </em>in stock prices.</p>

  <p>That&rsquo;s why Wall Street only tends to trade big, easily-identified share-price drivers&hellip;</p>

  <p>Things like earnings numbers, product launches, annual commodity demand, etc.</p>

  <p>However, Jonas designed our &ldquo;Kinetic Algorithm&rdquo; to look only for<em> effects,</em> not causes.</p>

  <p>That&rsquo;s because we don&rsquo;t care <em>why</em> a repeating cycle in stock prices exists&hellip;</p>

  <p>We only care that the cycle itself is <em>statistically significant </em>&mdash; and could lead our readers to big, fast profits.</p>

  <p>Remember all those &ldquo;hidden market forces&rdquo; I was talking about earlier?</p>

  <p>The truth is, <u>you don&rsquo;t have to know what they are to make a fortune trading them</u>.</p>

  <p>Again, it&rsquo;s like gravity, magnetism, and lift.</p>

  <p>Nobody knows exactly WHY these hidden forces work&hellip;</p>

  <p>We just know that they always DO work in a certain manner.</p>

  <p>This &ldquo;effect only&rdquo; way of looking at data is how we found the lucrative rhythm I just showed you in the prices of certain stocks.</p>

  <p>And speaking of &ldquo;certain stocks&rdquo; &mdash; let me just quickly explain that part to you.</p>

  <p>Jonas built our Kinetic Algorithm to filter stocks for three <em>very specific criteria</em> that dramatically increase their profit potential.</p>

  <p>Now, as you might expect, I can&rsquo;t say much about those in this forum.</p>

  <p>But I CAN say that out of over 600,000 publicly traded companies in the world&hellip;</p>

  <p>Only 1,683 stocks meet these criteria &mdash; yet are easily traded on U.S. exchanges.</p>

  <p>I can also say that these particular stocks give you a <em>mathematical profit advantage&hellip;</em></p>

  <p><u>Because all of them have a tradable &ldquo;rhythm&rdquo; in their price history</u>.</p>

  <p>That&rsquo;s another way of saying they all have Kinetic Profit Windows you could play for literally <em>millions of dollars per year</em>.</p>

  <p>OK, so that&rsquo;s pretty much all the background you&rsquo;ll need to understand the incredible moneymaking power of our new K Sign Indicator.</p>

  <p>Now let me walk you through exactly how a K Sign trade works&hellip;</p>

  <h3>Putting it all together:<br class="hidebr" />
  How to trade the &ldquo;K Signs&rdquo; for <em>life-changing wealth</em> &mdash; in just <u>10 minutes a month</u></h3>

  <p>Obviously, our Kinetic Algorithm is an <em>incredibly complex</em> piece of computer code&hellip;</p>

  <p>But as I&rsquo;ve been showing you &mdash; what it actually does is <em>dirt-simple</em>.</p>

  <p>It detects subtle rhythms in the price data of certain stocks over a period of years&hellip;</p>

  <p>Then uses them to predict the best times to trade those stocks in the <em>coming</em> year.</p>

  <p>That&rsquo;s the whole ball of wax, right there.</p>

  <p>Now I want to show you how those trades come together in the real world.</p>

  <p>A potential trade begins when the algorithm detects a statically valid rhythm in a stock&rsquo;s long-term price history&hellip;</p>

  <p>Once that happens, the &ldquo;algo&rdquo; automatically does three things:</p>

  <ul class="checkmark">
  	<li>
  	<p><strong>Records these upticks (Kinetic Profit Windows) by date range</strong></p>
  	</li>
  	<li>
  	<p><strong>Graphically diagrams their rhythm in a &ldquo;prediction line&rdquo;</strong></p>
  	</li>
  	<li>
  	<p><strong>Projects that line a full year into the stock&rsquo;s future</strong></p>
  	</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Now, I know that might seem like a lot to process&hellip;</p>

  <p>But it&rsquo;s easy to wrap your head around when I walk you through it, step by step.</p>

  <p>To start doing that, let&rsquo;s revisit the very first K Sign trade example I showed you earlier. You remember that one, right?</p>

  <p>It was a 667% potential win on Vale, SA &mdash; between January 1st and February 16th of this year.</p>
  <img alt="Vale, SA" class="image_center" src="https://d13p2xj50zkyqm.cloudfront.net/promos/AF/PMT/K_Sign_0617/PMT_KSign_Chart_022.png" />
  <p>Now I&rsquo;m going to walk you through how the algorithm could have predicted this Kinetic Profit Window a year in advance&hellip;</p>

  <p>We began by giving our Kinetic Algorithm the right starting date to crunch the data for &mdash; in this case, February 16th of 2016.</p>

  <p>That&rsquo;s exactly <em>one year before</em> the &ldquo;sell&rdquo; date of our VALE trade example.</p>

  <p>OK, so using that date as its starting point, the algorithm goes to town on the historical price data for VALE...</p>

  <p>And detects a statistically valid rhythm in its price history. Based on this rhythm in the past data&hellip;</p>

  <p>It then predicts four distinct price upticks in Vale, SA, stock over the next 12 months.</p>

  <p>Here&rsquo;s the list, exactly as the algorithm spit it out:</p>
  </div>

  <div class="row">
  <div class="medium-6 medium-push-6 columns"><img alt="ZEP/VALE" class="image_center" src="https://d13p2xj50zkyqm.cloudfront.net/promos/AF/PMT/K_Sign_0617/PMT_KSign_Chart_023.png" /></div>

  <div class="medium-6 medium-pull-6 columns">
  <p style="margin-top: 0px"><strong>Kinetic Profit Window #1</strong>: March 14th to April 9th</p>

  <p><strong>Kinetic Profit Window #2</strong>: June 24th to July 28th</p>

  <p><strong>Kinetic Profit Window #3</strong>: August 26th to November 6th</p>

  <p><strong>Kinetic Profit Window #4</strong>: January 1st to February 16th</p>
  </div>
  </div>

  <div class="row small-12 column">
  <p style="margin-top: 0px">Once more &mdash; just to make sure you&rsquo;re perfectly clear&hellip;</p>

  <p>These Kinetic Profit Windows are the specific time periods in which the data shows VALE being <u>statistically predisposed to tick up</u>, year after year.</p>

  <p>And remember, even though these periods of time have already passed&hellip;</p>

  <p>The algorithm &ldquo;thinks&rdquo; it&rsquo;s making a projection of the future.</p>

  <p>Again, that&rsquo;s because we gave it a theoretical starting date that&rsquo;s a <em>year before</em> our VALE trade example closed out.</p>

  <p>A nice fringe benefit of using this starting date is that it enables us to compare what the algorithm <em>predicted</em> would happen&hellip;</p>

  <p>To what <em>actually happened</em> to the stock over that 12-month period.</p>

  <p>So real quick, let&rsquo;s see how this &ldquo;future&rdquo; unfolded in real life for VALE investors&hellip;</p>
  <img alt="Vale, SA" class="image_center" src="https://d13p2xj50zkyqm.cloudfront.net/promos/AF/PMT/K_Sign_0617/PMT_KSign_Chart_024.png" />
  <p>Whoa, now, would you look at that!</p>

  <p>When we overlay the four Kinetic Profit Windows our algorithm predicted on top of VALE&rsquo;s actual price during this 12-month period&hellip;</p>

  <p>We see that <strong>you could&rsquo;ve made money in every single one of them.</strong></p>

  <p>But the &ldquo;belle of the ball&rdquo; was this 667% profit opportunity from earlier this year.</p>
  <img alt="Vale, SA" class="image_center" src="https://d13p2xj50zkyqm.cloudfront.net/promos/AF/PMT/K_Sign_0617/PMT_KSign_Chart_022.png" />
  <p>As you can see, this Kinetic Profit Window matched up <em>almost perfectly</em> with the high and low points of the price motion it predicted&hellip;</p>

  <p>And both the &ldquo;buy&rdquo; and &ldquo;sell&rdquo; dates were clearly signaled by distinct K Signs in our indicator&rsquo;s two lines.</p>

  <p>You remember those K Signs, don&rsquo;t you?</p>

  <p>Good. Because they&rsquo;re the single most important piece of this puzzle&hellip;</p>

  <p>And now&rsquo;s the right time for me to finally show you <em>exactly what they are</em>.</p>

  <p>In simplest terms, a K Sign is your signal to TRADE RIGHT NOW.</p>

  <p><u>Because they&rsquo;re real-time signals that our algorithm&rsquo;s predictions are coming true</u>.</p>

  <p>K Signs form when two abstract lines come together to <em>visually confirm</em> the Kinetic Profit Windows our algorithm projects.</p>

  <p>We call these two lines the &ldquo;prediction&rdquo; line and the &ldquo;correction&rdquo; line.</p>

  <p>And they&rsquo;re actually <em>very easy</em> to understand.</p>

  <p>The prediction line &mdash; which I mentioned earlier &mdash; is simply a linear diagram of the &ldquo;rhythm&rdquo; we detect in a stock&rsquo;s price data.</p>

  <p>Here&rsquo;s what the raw prediction line looked like for VALE in the 12 months before our theoretical 667% trading win:</p>
  <img alt="Vale, SA" class="image_center" src="https://d13p2xj50zkyqm.cloudfront.net/promos/AF/PMT/K_Sign_0617/PMT_KSign_Chart_025.png" />
  <p>Now, as you can see, without the backdrop of a price chart or anything else to give it context&hellip;</p>

  <p>This &ldquo;raw data&rdquo; version of the prediction line appears <em>very </em>abstract indeed.</p>

  <p>But things get a little clearer when we highlight and define the four upticks in this data rhythm&hellip;</p>

  <p>Otherwise known as the Kinetic Profit Windows.</p>
  <img alt="Vale, SA" class="image_center" src="https://d13p2xj50zkyqm.cloudfront.net/promos/AF/PMT/K_Sign_0617/PMT_KSign_Chart_026.png" />
  <p>And it all comes together nicely when you see this line in a real-world context.</p>

  <p>You already got a rough idea of what that looks like a minute ago&hellip;</p>

  <p>When I showed you how these Kinetic Profit Windows played out for VALE in the year leading up to our 667% winning trade example.</p>
  <img alt="Vale, SA" class="image_center" src="https://d13p2xj50zkyqm.cloudfront.net/promos/AF/PMT/K_Sign_0617/PMT_KSign_Chart_027.png" />
  <p>Now you can see what those &ldquo;windows&rdquo; look like with their prediction line in place.</p>

  <p>As you&rsquo;ll notice, the overall uptrend in VALE&rsquo;s price&hellip;</p>

  <p>And the varying intensity of the price moves within the Kinetic Profit Windows&hellip;</p>

  <p>Has changed the way this prediction line looks, compared to its &ldquo;raw data&rdquo; version.</p>

  <p>But you can also see how the time periods and price upticks it predicts remain <em>exactly the same</em>.</p>

  <p>That&rsquo;s because it&rsquo;s the exact same line&hellip;</p>

  <p>Just shown in a <em>real-world</em> configuration instead of an <em>abstract</em> one.</p>

  <p>OK, now that you can visualize what this line represents in a real-world context&hellip;</p>

  <p>I need you to pay <strong>very close attention</strong> &mdash; because this next part is <em>crucial</em>.</p>

  <p>Although it&rsquo;s the prediction line&rsquo;s job to show us <u>when to expect upticks</u> in a stock&rsquo;s price 12 months into the future&hellip;</p>

  <p>It&rsquo;s the appearance of the K Signs in <em>real time</em> that tells us when to <u>actually trade those stocks</u>.</p>

  <p>And that&rsquo;s where the <em>second</em> line of the K Sign Indicator comes into the picture.</p>

  <p>Unlike the prediction line, which is projected a year into the future&hellip;</p>

  <p>The &ldquo;correction&rdquo; line is simply the real-time price action, corrected for volatility.</p>
  <img alt="Vale, SA" class="image_center" src="https://d13p2xj50zkyqm.cloudfront.net/promos/AF/PMT/K_Sign_0617/PMT_KSign_Chart_028.png" />
  <p>It&rsquo;s the fluid line a stock&rsquo;s price action <em>would</em> look like&hellip;</p>

  <p>Without the news cycle, Wall Street shenanigans, international incidents, or investor emotion jerking it around all the time.</p>

  <p>Redrawing it in this manner turns a jagged line that can be hard to interpret&hellip;</p>

  <p>Into a smooth line that &mdash; when coupled with the prediction line &mdash; makes a nice, obvious K Sign.</p>

  <p>In other words, a clear signal to either &ldquo;buy&rdquo; or &ldquo;sell&rdquo; for maximum potential profits.</p>

  <p>Again, the appearance of K Signs <em>confirms in real time</em>&hellip;</p>

  <p>&nbsp;</p>

  <p><u>The price movements our algorithm predicts a year into the future</u>.</p>

  <p>The combination of these two elements &mdash; the algorithm&rsquo;s prediction and the K Sign that verifies that it&rsquo;s happening&hellip;</p>

  <p>Is the revolutionary trading breakthrough we call the K Sign Indicator.</p>

  <p>And as I touched on before, even though the technology and theory behind the K Sign Indicator is <em>incredibly complex</em>&hellip;</p>

  <p>Using it to rake in potential returns of up to <strong>27 times your money per trade</strong>&hellip;</p>

  <p>And rack up <strong>over $2 million a year &mdash; if not, much more</strong>&hellip;</p>

  <p>Is <em>incredibly easy</em>.</p>

  <p>Because we (and our algorithm) do <em>all the hard work for you</em>&hellip;</p>

  <p>All you need to do is be ready to &ldquo;buy&rdquo; or &ldquo;sell&rdquo; when the K Signs say so.</p>

  <p>YOU don&rsquo;t have to monitor an algorithm&rsquo;s statistical predictions for 1,683 stocks&hellip;</p>

  <p>We do that.</p>

  <p>YOU don&#39;t have to convert the &ldquo;rhythms&rdquo; this algorithm detects in the data into lines on a bunch of stock charts&hellip;</p>

  <p>We do that.</p>

  <p>YOU don&rsquo;t have to correct the volatility out of billions of stock-price data points and create an entirely new price line&hellip;</p>

  <p>We do that.</p>

  <p>YOU don&rsquo;t have to constantly watch stock prices to see when the &ldquo;prediction&rdquo; and &ldquo;correction&rdquo; lines converge to form K Signs&hellip;</p>

  <p>We do that.</p>

  <p>Again, all you need to do is set aside about 5 minutes, roughly every other week&hellip;</p>

  <p>And have some starting capital to trade the K Sign recommendations that interest you.</p>

  <p>We&rsquo;ll handle the rest &mdash; the analysis, the prediction, the confirmation, and the K Sign trade recommendations.</p>

  <p>But before I show you how we can give you an ongoing stream of K Sign trades that could change your life in <em>minutes per month</em>&hellip;</p>

  <p>I want to make good on a promise I made you a while ago.</p>

  <p>I&rsquo;m going to show you &mdash; right now&hellip;</p>

  <h3>How the K Sign Indicator could&rsquo;ve scored you <em>over $2 million last year </em></h3>

  <p>What you&rsquo;re about to see is a full year&rsquo;s worth of theoretical returns from 2016&hellip;</p>

  <p>Based on just one K Sign trade approximately every other week.</p>

  <p>Now let me take you through these trades, rapid-fire&hellip;</p>

  <p>So you can really appreciate the incredible moneymaking power of our K Sign breakthrough.</p>

  <p>The first trade the K Sign Indicator flagged, on January 4, 2016, was for Belden, Inc&hellip;</p>
  <img alt="Belden, Inc." class="image_center" src="https://d13p2xj50zkyqm.cloudfront.net/promos/AF/PMT/K_Sign_0617/PMT_KSign_Chart_029.png" />
  <p>A little-known IT player that could&rsquo;ve scored you solid gains of 183% by mid-year.</p>

  <p>Then on January 18th, it flagged a monster win &mdash; Carrizo Oil and Gas&hellip;</p>
  <img alt="Carrizo Oil &amp; Gas, Inc." class="image_center" src="https://d13p2xj50zkyqm.cloudfront.net/promos/AF/PMT/K_Sign_0617/PMT_KSign_Chart_020.png" />
  <p>Which paid out <em>borderline unbelievable</em> 2,705% profits in under five months.</p>

  <p>Yep, that one score alone could&rsquo;ve scored you <em>over 27 times your money!</em></p>

  <p>At end of the month, the indicator signaled a &ldquo;buy&rdquo; on Brazilian steel company SID&hellip;</p>
  <img alt="SID" class="image_center" src="https://d13p2xj50zkyqm.cloudfront.net/promos/AF/PMT/K_Sign_0617/PMT_KSign_Chart_030.png" />
  <p>For a hefty 597% win in just a little over two months!</p>

  <p>For mid-February, it picked another <em>absolute barn-burner</em>&hellip;</p>

  <p>Dycom Industries, for a 2,040% win (or over 20 times your money).</p>
  <img alt="Dycom Industries, Inc." class="image_center" src="https://d13p2xj50zkyqm.cloudfront.net/promos/AF/PMT/K_Sign_0617/PMT_KSign_Chart_019.png" />
  <p>On February 29th &mdash; Leap Day &mdash; a Kinetic Profit Window opened up on ONEOK, Inc&hellip;</p>
  <img alt="ONEOK" class="image_center" src="https://d13p2xj50zkyqm.cloudfront.net/promos/AF/PMT/K_Sign_0617/PMT_KSign_Chart_031.png" />
  <p>For excellent gains of 594% in your pocket by mid-summer.</p>

  <p>Your &ldquo;Ides of March&rdquo; pick was none other than mortgage giant Fannie Mae&hellip;</p>
  <img alt="Fannie Mae" class="image_center" src="https://d13p2xj50zkyqm.cloudfront.net/promos/AF/PMT/K_Sign_0617/PMT_KSign_Chart_032.png" />
  <p>For solid 89% gains.</p>

  <p>On March 31st, the algorithm&rsquo;s read on the data put you in another mortgage player, FMCC&hellip;</p>
  <img alt="FMCC" class="image_center" src="https://d13p2xj50zkyqm.cloudfront.net/promos/AF/PMT/K_Sign_0617/PMT_KSign_Chart_033.png" />
  <p>For a tidy 172% win in barely over two months&rsquo; time.</p>

  <p>The next &ldquo;crusher&rdquo; came on April 13th, which was a <em>lucky</em> day if you like money.</p>
  <img alt="DXC Technology" class="image_center" src="https://d13p2xj50zkyqm.cloudfront.net/promos_3/AF/PMT/K_Sign_0617/PMT_KSign_Chart_034.png" />
  <p>Because the Kinetic Profit Window for DXC Technology could&rsquo;ve scored you 1,937% gains&hellip;</p>

  <p>Or over 19 times your money &mdash; in <em>less than eight weeks!</em></p>

  <p>The K Sign pick for the last week in April wasn&rsquo;t too shabby, either&hellip;</p>
  <img alt="Monsanto" class="image_center" src="https://d13p2xj50zkyqm.cloudfront.net/promos/AF/PMT/K_Sign_0617/PMT_KSign_Chart_035.png" />
  <p>A rockin&rsquo; 561% gain in under seven weeks on Monsanto.</p>

  <p>Next up, the indicator flagged MGE Energy, on May 9th&hellip;</p>
  <img alt="MGE Energy" class="image_center" src="https://d13p2xj50zkyqm.cloudfront.net/promos/AF/PMT/K_Sign_0617/PMT_KSign_Chart_036.png" />
  <p>Handing you another nice triple-digit win on the year &mdash; 286% to be exact.</p>

  <p>On May 24th, the K Sign flashed to buy electricity holding company CIG&hellip;</p>
  <img alt="CIG" class="image_center" src="https://d13p2xj50zkyqm.cloudfront.net/promos/AF/PMT/K_Sign_0617/PMT_KSign_Chart_037.png" />
  <p>And pocket a sizzling <em>740% score in under two months!</em></p>

  <p>First week of June, the trade was Cathay General Bancorp&hellip;</p>
  <img alt="Cathay General Bancorp" class="image_center" src="https://d13p2xj50zkyqm.cloudfront.net/promos/AF/PMT/K_Sign_0617/PMT_KSign_Chart_038.png" />
  <p>Along with a nice, civilized 144% win.</p>

  <p>Then on June 20th, it was steelmaker SID again, in its second Kinetic Profit Window of the year&hellip;</p>
  <img alt="SID" class="image_center" src="https://d13p2xj50zkyqm.cloudfront.net/promos/AF/PMT/K_Sign_0617/PMT_KSign_Chart_039.png" />
  <p>It was a good one, too &mdash; a red-hot <em>308% win in less than a month!</em></p>

  <p>July 8th saw the &ldquo;buy&rdquo; K Sign emerge for Tower Semiconductor&hellip;</p>
  <img alt="Tower Semiconductor" class="image_center" src="https://d13p2xj50zkyqm.cloudfront.net/promos/AF/PMT/K_Sign_0617/PMT_KSign_Chart_040.png" />
  <p>Which led to a big win of 582% in your theoretical &ldquo;pocket.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Third week of July, the indicator was all about Northwest Bancshares&hellip;</p>
  <img alt="Northwest Bancshares" class="image_center" src="https://d13p2xj50zkyqm.cloudfront.net/promos/AF/PMT/K_Sign_0617/PMT_KSign_Chart_041.png" />
  <p>And the awesome 712% gains they could&rsquo;ve paid you in under five months.</p>

  <p>On August 4th, FMCC came up for its second Kinetic Profit Window of the year&hellip;</p>
  <img alt="FMCC" class="image_center" src="https://d13p2xj50zkyqm.cloudfront.net/promos/AF/PMT/K_Sign_0617/PMT_KSign_Chart_042.png" />
  <p>This one was even <em>better</em> than the first one &mdash; a solid 293% win.</p>

  <p>For mid-August, S&amp;T Bancorp was the star of the show&hellip;</p>
  <img alt="S&amp;T Bancorp" class="image_center" src="https://d13p2xj50zkyqm.cloudfront.net/promos/AF/PMT/K_Sign_0617/PMT_KSign_Chart_043.png" />
  <p>Bowing with 723% profits in under 4&frac12; months.</p>

  <p>OK, now this next one is <em>priceless</em>.</p>

  <p>Out of all the 1,683 stocks our indicator tracks&hellip;</p>

  <p>The best trade it saw at the end of August was none other than Wall Street giant <em>Goldman Sachs!</em></p>
  <img alt="Goldman Sachs" class="image_center" src="https://d13p2xj50zkyqm.cloudfront.net/promos/AF/PMT/K_Sign_0617/PMT_KSign_Chart_044.png" />
  <p>And that trade could&rsquo;ve scored you <em>818% gains in four months flat.</em></p>

  <p>So you&rsquo;d have made an 8X profit multiple &mdash; by NOT letting Goldman trade your money with <em>their</em> algorithms&hellip;</p>

  <p>But by trading their stock using <em>our</em> algorithm!</p>

  <p>How&rsquo;s THAT for irony?!?</p>

  <p>Anyway, back to the 2016 K Sign win parade.</p>

  <p>September 12th saw an opportunity on Cogent Communications&hellip;</p>
  <img alt="Cogent Communications" class="image_center" src="https://d13p2xj50zkyqm.cloudfront.net/promos/AF/PMT/K_Sign_0617/PMT_KSign_Chart_045.png" />
  <p>For a sedate, but solid 82% win.</p>

  <p>The 26th of the month, on the other hand, showed you a trade on Deutsche Bank&hellip;</p>
  <img alt="Deutsche Bank" class="image_center" src="https://d13p2xj50zkyqm.cloudfront.net/promos/AF/PMT/K_Sign_0617/PMT_KSign_Chart_046.png" />
  <p>For a very substantial win of 675% in just over 10 weeks.</p>

  <p>Then, on October 10th, another quadruple-digit killer came out of the data&hellip;</p>
  <img alt="NVIDIA" class="image_center" src="https://d13p2xj50zkyqm.cloudfront.net/promos/AF/PMT/K_Sign_0617/PMT_KSign_Chart_047.png" />
  <p>Electronics leader NVIDIA &mdash; for a massive <em>1,269% win in under three months.</em></p>

  <p>And on the heels of that one, another huge win with Integer Corp.&hellip;</p>
  <img alt="Integer Corp." class="image_center" src="https://d13p2xj50zkyqm.cloudfront.net/promos/AF/PMT/K_Sign_0617/PMT_KSign_Chart_048.png" />
  <p>This one an eye-popping <em>1,006% in just 35 days!</em></p>

  <p>Yeah, that&rsquo;s right &mdash; back-to-back quads. The K Sign Indicator was hot in October.</p>

  <p>On November 7th, the &ldquo;buy&rdquo; K Sign lit up for footwear maker Skechers&hellip;</p>
  <img alt="Skechers" class="image_center" src="https://d13p2xj50zkyqm.cloudfront.net/promos/AF/PMT/K_Sign_0617/PMT_KSign_Chart_049.png" />
  <p>And the &ldquo;sell&rdquo; sign lit up in the data just 26 days later, for 278% gains.</p>

  <p>The third week of the month, it was Methode Electronics in the hot seat&hellip;</p>
  <img alt="Methode Electronics" class="image_center" src="https://d13p2xj50zkyqm.cloudfront.net/promos/AF/PMT/K_Sign_0617/PMT_KSign_Chart_050.png" />
  <p>They&rsquo;d have put 256% profits in your piggybank &mdash; in just 20 days!</p>

  <p>December&rsquo;s first K Sign trade was TC Pipelines&hellip;</p>
  <img alt="TC Pipelines" class="image_center" src="https://d13p2xj50zkyqm.cloudfront.net/promos/AF/PMT/K_Sign_0617/PMT_KSign_Chart_052.png" />
  <p>Which pumped out 255% gains in just over three weeks.</p>

  <p>And to finish up the year, a nice, double-your-money win of 100% on the nose&hellip;</p>
  <img alt="PZE" class="image_center" src="https://d13p2xj50zkyqm.cloudfront.net/promos/AF/PMT/K_Sign_0617/PMT_KSign_Chart_051.png" />
  <p><em>In just 10 days</em> &mdash; on Argentine refiner PZE.</p>

  <p>So there you have it.</p>

  <p>A whole calendar year&rsquo;s worth of biweekly K Sign Indicator trades&hellip;</p>

  <p>Now of course, not <em>every</em> trade our algorithm picks ends up a winner.</p>

  <p>The trades you&rsquo;ve just seen were selected from the data because of the way they fell in the calendar last year.</p>

  <p>Remember, I wanted to illustrate how you could get rich making one five-minute trade every two weeks&hellip;</p>

  <p>And the trades that showed that frequency best in the data <em>all happened to be wins</em>.</p>

  <p>To be sure, there WERE some losing trades in the data for 2016&hellip;</p>

  <p>And in other tested years, too.</p>

  <p>The 93.5% accuracy rate I&rsquo;ve been telling you about is an <u>average of the algorithm&rsquo;s back-tested performance over the last eight calendar years</u>.</p>

  <p>However, it&rsquo;s worth noting that in this extensive back test&hellip;</p>

  <p>Our Kinetic Algorithm <em>did not show a single loss</em> for one particular year, 2010.</p>

  <p>So the 26-0 win/loss record I just showed you for 2016 isn&rsquo;t such a big stretch.</p>

  <p>It&rsquo;s also worth noting that the K Sign Indicator could actually have <em>made you money in 2008 </em>&mdash; while the rest of the financial world was burning.</p>

  <p>But I digress again&hellip;</p>

  <p>I was about to show you how the trades I just walked you through totaled up to cumulative returns of <em>17,420%!</em></p>

  <p style="margin-top: 0px">Put another way: On a base investment of just $10,000 each&hellip;</p>

  <p>You could have ended up with a total of <strong>$2,002,000</strong> on these trades.</p>

  <p>With a starting position of $25,000 per trade, let&rsquo;s say&hellip;</p>

  <p>That total return explodes to <strong><em>$5,005,000!</em></strong></p>

  <p>Of course, you should NEVER invest or trade with money you can&rsquo;t afford to lose.</p>

  <p>The difference is that our new trading breakthrough stacks the deck in your favor like <em>nothing else you&rsquo;ve ever seen</em>&hellip;</p>

  <p>Remember, you&rsquo;re getting access to an algorithm that&rsquo;s data-tested to be <u>93.5% accurate at predicting winning stock picks over eight calendar years</u> running!</p>

  <p>Needless to say, that&rsquo;s a HUGE mathematical advantage in leading you to <strong>incredible win opportunities of up to 2,705% or more&hellip;</strong></p>

  <p>And a life of <em>ridiculous wealth</em> from now on.</p>

  <p>Everything I&rsquo;ve shown you has surely proven this fact beyond any possible doubt.</p>

  <p>So now all that&rsquo;s left is to show you how to tap into this breakthrough yourself&hellip;</p>

  <h3>Introducing <em>Kinetic Profits</em> &mdash; your new secret to life-changing personal wealth</h3>

  <p>As the longtime anchor of the Trading Research Desk here at Seven Figure Publishing&hellip;</p>

  <p>I can honestly say that <u>we&rsquo;ve never been this excited to offer a new service to you</u>.</p>

  <p>Again, that&rsquo;s because in all our 25 years in the trenches of personal finance&hellip;</p>

  <p>We&rsquo;ve never seen anything as potentially life-changing for our readers as the K Sign profit indicator.</p>

  <p>Never before have we seen a statistically valid way of picking winning stock trades that&rsquo;s <em>93.5% accurate</em>&hellip;</p>

  <p>And that can predict profit opportunities in certain stocks <em>365 days into the future</em>.</p>

  <p>Like I said at the beginning here&hellip;</p>

  <p>I&rsquo;m absolutely convinced that nothing else out there could make you richer, faster than this new breakthrough of ours.</p>

  <p>That&rsquo;s why Seven Figure Publishing has created an entirely new service around it.</p>

  <p>It&rsquo;s called <strong><em>Kinetic Profits</em></strong>.</p>

  <p>This new service was designed from the ground up to do more than just level the field between you and Wall Street&hellip;</p>

  <p>But actually give you a <u>major statistical trading advantage</u> over them.</p>

  <p><strong><em>Kinetic Profits</em></strong> is unlike any other trading research service out there.</p>

  <p>It&rsquo;s 100% driven by data, and nothing else.</p>

  <p>The Kinetic Algorithm practically <em>runs the show</em>&hellip;</p>

  <p>Jonas, your editor and the K Sign Indicator&rsquo;s developer, does <em>three things</em>&hellip;</p>

  <ol class="numbers">
  	<li>
  	<p>Maintains and improves the Kinetic Algorithm (and the computer code that drives it) for maximum accuracy and reliability</p>
  	</li>
  	<li>
  	<p>Keeps track of the algorithm&rsquo;s predictions of future Kinetic Profit Windows in the prices of specific stocks</p>
  	</li>
  	<li>
  	<p>Monitors the price action in these stocks, corrects out the volatility, and reports to you when tradable K Signs appear.</p>
  	</li>
  </ol>

  <p>Of course, he doesn&rsquo;t pass along everything he finds as an official recommendation&hellip;</p>

  <p>He&rsquo;ll reserve only the best opportunities from this system for <strong><em>Kinetic Profits</em></strong> readers.</p>

  <p>All you need to do is keep an eye out for the K Sign &ldquo;buy&rdquo; and &ldquo;sell&rdquo; research alerts Jonas issues&hellip;</p>

  <p>And trade them if they look good to you.</p>

  <p>That MIGHT take you <em>5 minutes every other week</em>.</p>

  <p>If you&rsquo;re willing to do at least that much, you could clean up on win after win of up to <strong>27 times your money or more</strong>&hellip;</p>

  <p>As I&rsquo;ve just spent the last half-hour showing you.</p>

  <p>It really can be <em>just that simple</em> on your end&hellip;</p>

  <p>But make no mistake &mdash;<strong><em>Kinetic Profits</em></strong> is very complicated on our end.</p>

  <p>The Kinetic Algorithm&rsquo;s computational code is unbelievably complex.</p>

  <p>In fact, it&rsquo;s gotten so complex that we&rsquo;ve recently begun using a <u>secure off-site supercomputer facility</u> to harness its full power.</p>

  <p>The predictive code itself also needs <em>constant</em> maintenance&hellip;</p>

  <p>And Jonas is continuously testing different variables to potentially improve the algorithm&rsquo;s accuracy.</p>

  <p>I&rsquo;ll give you a quick example of that&hellip;</p>

  <p>Until recently, our algorithm was statistically verified to have a maximum average accuracy rate of 83.5%.</p>

  <p>Now that&rsquo;s still <em>ridiculously good</em>, of course.</p>

  <p>But at around 7PM on Friday, March 24th, of this year&hellip;</p>

  <p>Jonas introduced a <u>new, top-secret variable</u> to the code.</p>

  <p>We&rsquo;ll call it the &ldquo;T3M&rdquo; variable.</p>

  <p>And <em>18 million simulated trades</em> later&hellip;</p>

  <p>That average accuracy rate had jumped to 93.5%!</p>

  <p>That&rsquo;s the magic of a 100% algorithmic trading platform.</p>

  <p>You don&#39;t have to <em>actually trade</em> for years on end&hellip;</p>

  <p>To verify the validity of your trading strategy over the span of those years.</p>

  <p>You can do it in hours, with data.</p>

  <p>Now here&rsquo;s the cherry on top: It&rsquo;s not only conceivable &mdash; but <em>very likely</em>&hellip;</p>

  <p>That additional coding tweaks and &ldquo;machine learning&rdquo; could allow our algorithm to become <em>even more accurate</em> at finding stock market wins.</p>

  <p>And if you&rsquo;re part of <strong><em>Kinetic Profits</em></strong>&hellip;</p>

  <p>You&rsquo;ll reap the benefits of these improvements <em>as they happen</em>.</p>

  <p>That means your trading success rate could get better and better as time goes on&hellip;</p>

  <p><em>Until you&rsquo;re so rich you don&rsquo;t need any more money</em>.</p>

  <p>Again, my point is that <strong><em>Kinetic Profits</em></strong> is more technologically advanced than any other trading research service we&rsquo;ve ever published&hellip;</p>

  <p>Or that we&rsquo;ve <em>ever even seen</em>.</p>

  <p>But for you, getting rich with <strong><em>Kinetic Profits</em></strong> can be as little as five minutes&rsquo; work, every other week.</p>

  <p>Before you sign up for this service, though&hellip;</p>

  <h3>There&rsquo;s something <em>important</em><br class="hidebr" />
  I want you to promise me</h3>

  <p>As I told you earlier&hellip;</p>

  <p>The whole point of <strong><em>Kinetic Profits</em></strong> is to give its members a statistical advantage over the hedge funds and big Wall Street trading houses.</p>

  <p>Jonas could&rsquo;ve sold the algorithm behind the K Sign Indicator to some Wall Street hedge fund for an <em>absolute fortune</em>&hellip;</p>

  <p>But he didn&rsquo;t.</p>

  <p>Instead, he reserved it exclusively for the benefit of Seven Figure Publishing&rsquo;s readers.</p>

  <p>And we intend to do everything we can to keep this game-changing breakthrough in the hands of <strong><em>Kinetic Profits</em></strong> members only.</p>

  <p>So before we go any further down the road of MAKING you one of these members&hellip;</p>

  <p>I want your word on something.</p>

  <p>I want you to promise, right now&hellip;</p>

  <p>That you will not republish, sell, post on the web, or otherwise circulate <u>anything you receive as part of your membership</u>.</p>

  <p>If you CAN&rsquo;T make that promise&hellip;</p>

  <p>Then I&rsquo;d like you to close this now and move on. I thank you for your time.</p>

  <p>Same deal if you&rsquo;re a professional trader&hellip;</p>

  <p>Unless you can promise that the information you receive as part of your <strong><em>Kinetic Profits</em></strong> membership is for your <u>personal use only</u>...</p>

  <p>And that you won&rsquo;t share it with your clients, your firm, or anyone else&hellip;</p>

  <p>Then I respectfully ask you to make no further effort toward joining this service.</p>

  <p>However, if you CAN make that pledge of <em>total informational security</em>&hellip;</p>

  <p>Then let&rsquo;s proceed with getting you signed up for <strong><em>Kinetic Profits</em></strong>.</p>

  <p>First, let me go over everything you&rsquo;ll get with your membership.</p>

  <p>Once you&rsquo;re signed up (which only takes a few minutes)&hellip;</p>

  <p>The first thing you&rsquo;ll receive, via email, is your official service &ldquo;Welcome Kit.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>You&rsquo;ll want to keep this someplace safe&hellip;</p>

  <p>Because it contains all your vital membership information.</p>

  <p>That includes the password you&rsquo;ll use to access the <strong><em>Kinetic Profits</em></strong> website.</p>

  <p>Soon after signing up, you&rsquo;ll begin to receive the core benefits of the service:</p>

  <ul class="none">
  	<li>
  	<p><strong>Urgent K Sign &ldquo;Buy&rdquo; Alerts </strong>&mdash; Whenever a &ldquo;buy&rdquo; K Sign appears in the stocks Jonas is watching, he&rsquo;ll send a purchase recommendation alert straight to your inbox&hellip;</p>

  	<p>This will include full details and charts on the emerging Kinetic Profit Window, and the expected returns based on the historic data.</p>
  	</li>
  	<li>
  	<p><strong>Urgent K Sign &ldquo;Sell&rdquo; Alerts</strong> &mdash; These won&rsquo;t come on any set schedule, but will hit your inbox whenever Jonas sees the &ldquo;sell&rdquo; K Sign flash for any open position&hellip;</p>

  	<p>This will typically happen at or near the end of a projected Kinetic Profit Window, but could come earlier or later if the time frame is altered by external factors.</p>
  	</li>
  	<li>
  	<p><strong>Members-only Live Events</strong> &mdash; Periodically, Jonas will host these 30- to 60-minute events, in which he&rsquo;ll cover a relevant topic of interest to <strong><em>Kinetic Profits</em></strong> members&hellip;</p>

  	<p>These could include trading tips and detailed tutorials on the algorithm, the K Signs, the Kinetic Profit Windows, or anything else Jonas thinks you need to know.</p>
  	</li>
  </ul>

  <p>For your convenience, the complete archive of ALL these items&hellip;</p>

  <p>Including recordings of the live events and PDFs of the Special Reports&hellip;</p>

  <p>Will be accessible to you 24/7 on the <strong><em>Kinetic Profits</em></strong> secure website.</p>

  <p>Once again, the password for this will be in your Welcome Kit.</p>

  <p>With these core benefits, getting rich with <strong><em>Kinetic Profits</em></strong> is as simple and straightforward as can possibly be.</p>

  <p>All you need to do is watch your email&hellip;</p>

  <p>Make the K Sign trades that Jonas alerts you to&hellip;</p>

  <p>And go home in a Maserati, if all goes as it should.</p>

  <p>It&rsquo;s about as simple (again, on your end) as any trading research service we&rsquo;ve ever released.</p>

  <p>However, to make absolutely sure <strong><em>Kinetic Profits</em></strong> is completely idiot-proof&hellip;</p>

  <p>We&rsquo;ve assembled a comprehensive &ldquo;bundle&rdquo; of materials to help you understand the service &mdash; and make incredible money with it.</p>

  <p>You&rsquo;ll also learn, in detail:</p>

  <div class="medium-6 medium-pull-6 columns">
  <p style="margin-top: 0px">Every trade example you&rsquo;ve seen in this bulletin is expressed in terms of its potential gain from <em>options</em> on the stocks.</p>

  <p>Why?</p>

  <p>Because when you&rsquo;ve got a mathematically proven way of winning 93.5% of the stock trades you make, on average&hellip;</p>

  <p>Why WOULDN&rsquo;T you take advantage of cheap, simple call options to multiply your gains on those stocks by 5, 10 &mdash; even <em>20-fold or more?</em></p>
  </div>
  </div>

  <div class="row small-12 column">
  <p style="margin-top: 0px">In this comprehensive, yet easy-to-grasp guidebook, Jonas will completely &ldquo;demystify&rdquo; options trading for you...</p>

  <p>He&rsquo;ll also show you everything you need to know to make options trading as lucrative and low-risk as possible. This includes:</p>

  <ul class="checkmark">
  	<li>
  	<p>A simple explanation of what options are, and how they make money</p>
  	</li>
  	<li>
  	<p>The three main components of all options trades (and what they mean)</p>
  	</li>
  	<li>
  	<p>The difference between &ldquo;in the money&rdquo; and &ldquo;out of the money&rdquo; options</p>

  	</li>
  	<li>
  	<p>How to buy options cheap, using options as &ldquo;portfolio insurance,&rdquo; and more&hellip;</p>
  	</li>
  </ul>

  <p>However, even though the K Sign Indicator is tailor-made for options trading&hellip;</p>

  <p>You don&rsquo;t HAVE to trade it that way. You can still get rich by just buying and selling shares of stock when the K Sign Indicator tells you to.</p>

  <p>For instance, the average return of the 26 trades I just showed you &mdash; in terms of share-price gains only &mdash; was 51% in 98 days.</p>

  <p>On an annualized basis, that rate of return would&rsquo;ve turned a $10,000 investment in each of these trades into <em>$751,400!</em></p>

  <p>If you&rsquo;re leery of options, you don&rsquo;t have to touch them if you don&rsquo;t want to.</p>

  <p>But with the K Sign Indicator&rsquo;s 93.5%-accurate algorithm in your corner, and this book by one of the world&rsquo;s best trading researchers to guide you&hellip;</p>

  <p>You could consider trading options with complete confidence.</p>

  <p>This exclusive bundle of materials will come to you in two forms:</p>

  <p>As digital PDFs, which you can access immediately after your membership in <strong><em>Kinetic Profits</em></strong> is confirmed (this only takes a few minutes)&hellip;</p>

  <p>And as hard-copy guides, which you&rsquo;ll receive in the mail a few days later.</p>

  <p>Keep in mind that these are FREE bonuses you&rsquo;ll receive as a <strong><em>Kinetic Profits</em></strong> member&hellip;</p>

  <p>That means they&rsquo;re yours to keep, forever.</p>

  <p>Now all that&rsquo;s left is deciding to sign up and get everything&hellip;</p>

  <h3>One-time offer, closing fast: A &ldquo;<u>$97,000 bonus&rdquo;</u>   <strong>ONLY for <em>Infinite Income MEMBERS LIKE YOU</em></strong></em></h3>

  <p>
  I’m not going to waste a lot of time justifying how much the    <strong><em>Kinetic Profits</em></strong> service should be worth to you.
  </p>
  <p>
      That’s because I already know that the ability to
      <strong>
          win 93.5% of the stock trades you make for the rest of your life
      </strong>
      …
  </p>
  <p>
  And rake in    <strong>up to 27 times your money on every one of those trades</strong>…
  </p>
  <p>
      <em>Is worth more than a million dollars</em>
      to you.
  </p>
  <p>
      That was the very first thing I asked you back at the beginning, remember?
  </p>
  <p>
      I also know that if I hadn’t <em>proved beyond any doubt</em> that our
      breakthrough K Sign Indicator could deliver you this caliber of profits…
  </p>
  <p>
      You wouldn’t still be reading this right now.
  </p>
  <p>
      So let’s just cut right to the deal, shall we?
  </p>
  <p>
      Don’t worry — you’re not going to pay <em>anywhere near</em> the million
      bucks you’ve already decided <strong><em>Kinetic Profits</em></strong> is
      really worth.
  </p>
  <p>
      In fact, because this is the very first time we’ve ever unveiled this
      service…
  </p>
  <p>
      And because the whole point of it is to level the field for everyday folks…
  </p>
  <p>
      We’re making this debut offer on <strong><em>Kinetic Profits</em></strong>
      the deal of a lifetime for you.
  </p>
  <p>
      But first, let me give some context to this deal…
  </p>
  <p>
      As you may already know, Seven Figure Publishing’s standard price for premium
      trading services is $2,000 per year.
  </p>
  <p>
      And yes, we sell the heck out of them at those prices.
  </p>
  <p>
      But this service is different than all the others.
  </p>
  <p>
  That’s because the <em>costs</em> involved in bringing <strong><em>Kinetic Profits</em></strong> to you…
  </p>
  <p>
      <u>
          Are substantially higher than any other service we’ve ever offered to
          our readers.
      </u>

  </p>
  <p>
      That is a bona-fide fact.
  </p>
  <p>
      We shell out an <em>astronomical </em>amount of money to house the Kinetic
      Algorithm in a secure underground facility more than 50 miles away…
  </p>
  <p>
      We also pay through the nose for the vast computing capacity the algorithm
      uses.
  </p>
  <p>
      There are other costs, too, which I won’t bore you with. I’m sure you get
      the point.
  </p>
  <p>
      I’m also sure that given these extra costs…
  </p>
  <p>
      And given the groundbreaking nature of the service itself — not to mention
      its <em>incredible</em> profit potential…
  </p>
  <p>
      You’d probably expect us to charge $10,000 a year for it.
  </p>
  <p>
      It would be a smoking-hot bargain at that price, too!
  </p>
  <p>
      And just in the interest of full disclosure…
  </p>
  <p>
      Yes — I’ve heard through the grapevine that it’s Seven Figure Publishing’s
  intention to ultimately charge as much as $10,000 a year for    <strong><em>Kinetic Profits</em></strong>.
  </p>
  <p>
  However, <u>because you’re already a </u>    <strong>Infinite Income LIFETIME MEMBER</strong>…
  </p>
  <p>
      You get a special, RIGHT NOW ONLY <strong>membership to</strong>
      <strong>
          <em>Kinetic Profits</em>

          <s>

      </strong>
  </p>
  <p>
      <strong>Only $500.</strong>
  </p>
  <p>
      Yes, you heard that right — not $3,000 per year…
  </p>
  <p>
  And NOT $3,000 TOTAL FOR ACCESS — to    <strong><em>Kinetic Profits</em></strong>.
  </p>
  <p>
      Just $500.
  </p>
  <p>
      It’s a thank you for becoming a Infinite Income member.

  </p>
  <p>
      And just to be clear…
  </p>
  <p>
      This $500- offer is NOT on some truncated version of the service.
  </p>
  <p>
  It’s for the full boat membership to    <strong><em>Kinetic Profits</em></strong>.
  </p>
  <p>
      All the alerts, reports, picks, K Sign trades, live events…
  </p>
  <p>
      And of course, the incredible profits.
  </p>
  <p>
      It’s ALL yours for just an <a>annual</a> fee of just $500..
  </p>
  <p>
      If you like what you’re getting with <em>Kinetic Profits</em> then don’t
      worry, you’ll automatically renew at this special rate at the end of your
      first <a>year</a>. Locking into this low rate for as long as you keep the
      subscription.
  </p>
  <p>
      That’s right. No matter what we charge for <em>Kinetic Profits</em> in the
      future, you will be locked into the lowest rate available.
  </p>
  <p>
      OK, so now that you fully understand exactly what you’re being offered
      today…
  </p>
  <p>
      Pick your jaw up off the floor and listen to the conditions of this deal.
  </p>
  <p>
      There are only two of them.
  </p>
  <p>
      The first condition is that <u>my Publisher…</u>
  </p>

<p>Has only agreed to offer you this incredible deal right now only.</p>

<p>You’re either in right now, or you never see this offer ever again.</p>

<p>That’s because it’s entirely possible that we’ll lose money on this deal over the long haul — so it won’t be open to you beyond right now.</p>


  <p>Starting right now, you’ll have a brief window of opportunity to get in on Kinetic Profits at this special $500 rate… ONLY for Infinite Income members.</p>

  <p>In other words, only for YOU!</p>

  <p>If you wait, it may very well cost you 10 grand a year to get in on this service later.</p>

  <p>So you&rsquo;d better pull the trigger now, or you&rsquo;ll get left out&hellip;</p>

  <p>And you don&rsquo;t want to be left out of this life-changing deal, I promise you.</p>

  <p>The second condition is that <u>there will be no refunds on this special deal</u>.</p>
