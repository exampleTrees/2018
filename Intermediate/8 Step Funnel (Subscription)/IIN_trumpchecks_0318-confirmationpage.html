          </p>
          <p>
          Another incredible move by President Trump that could send 12 <em>more</em> “Trump Bonus Checks” to you <em>per year</em>.
          </p>
          <p>
              That’s an average of receiving one “Trump Bonus Check” every single month.
          </p>
          <p>
              But you can only get access to these checks if you act immediately.
          </p>
          <p>
              Don’t worry. I’ll show you how…
          </p>
          <p>
              In my brand-new investment briefing “
              <strong>
                  <em>
                      Trump Bonus Checks Triple-Down: 3 Advanced Plays to Profit BIG”
                  </em>
              </strong>
              , I outline how you can collect <em>even more</em> income off “Trump Bonus
              Checks,” thanks to yet another deal President Trump is making for the
              American people...
          </p>
          <p>
              Let me explain…
          </p>
          <p>
              You see, Business Insider wrote that as a nation, we’ve
                  lost 5 MILLION middle class manufacturing jobs over the last two
                  decades.
          </p>
          <p>
          They went on to explain it’s because “…nations like China that use
              currency manipulation and domestic industrial subsidies to gain an export
              advantage.”
          </p>
          <p>
              That didn’t sit well with our President. So he decided to do something
              about it…
          </p>
          <p>
              And it’s already paying dividends for the American people.
          </p>
          <p>
          According to Market Watch, “U.S. steel prices have already scored a
              lift from President Donald Trump’s plan to tack a 25% tariff on steel
              imports…”
          </p>
          <p>
          U.S. News     wrote,
              “Steel and aluminum stocks rallied after President Donald Trump announced
              proposed tariffs… even as the Dow Jones industrial average dipped by 420
              points and market volatility increased…”
          </p>
          <p>
          And CNBC
              reported: “U.S. Steel shares are up more than 24 percent…”
          </p>
          <p>
              And this is just the beginning. There is so much more money to come.
          </p>
          <p>
              Including your own shot at 12 extra “Trump Bonus Checks” per year.
          </p>
          <p>
              You don’t see much reporting of the good news surrounding President Trump’s
              tariff move because like we’ve said before: it is now fashionable in
              mainstream media to mock and berate our own president.
          </p>
          <p>

          <h3>
              <strong>Exclusive “Triple-Down” Recommendation #1 </strong>
              <strong>(New Lifetime Members Only)</strong>
          </h3>

          <p>
              This steel company recently closed a deal to buy another business in their
              same vertical – but with a specific focus on hardware for the massively
              expanding nuclear industry.
          </p>
          <p>
          As a result, this company’s stock has climbed up over 24.5% over the last six months- over DOUBLE the industry average!
          </p>
          <p>
              It’s part of their overall strategy to acquire niche businesses with
              specialty product offerings that will add immense shareholder value and
              impressive returns.
          </p>
          <p>
              There is continued demand for more steel in the aerospace and automotive
              industries and their acquisition strategy will offer the opportunity to
              capitalize on these needs, delivering incredible value for shareholders.
          </p>

          <h3>
              <strong>Exclusive “Triple-Down” Recommendation #2 </strong>
              <strong>(New Lifetime Members Only)</strong>
          </h3>

          <p>
              The CEO of one of the largest producers of steel and steel-related products
              in America has been very vocal of his support of President Trump’s new
              tariffs on foreign competition.
          </p>
          <p>
              On a major news network recently he said:
          </p>
          <p>
              <em>
                  “The problem is that the demand has been stolen by the illegally traded
                  imports…
              </em>
          </p>
          <p>
              <em>
                  Once we see that reversed, demand will return, and we definitely will
                  bring our people back and increase our utilization and our employment,"
              </em>
          </p>
          <p>
              This will mean an estimated 33,500 new jobs for Americans and a stronger
              economy – not to mention the huge demand that will come with these new
              restrictions on foreign metals.
          </p>
          <p>
              And with the MOST production capability of anyone else in America, this
              company is poised to snatch up a lot of that new business and make
              investors a lot of money.
          </p>
          <h3>
              <strong>Exclusive “Triple-Down” Recommendation #3 </strong><br/>
              <strong>(New Lifetime Members Only)</strong>
          </h3>
          <p>
              This company has already entered into the lucrative auto parts niche with
              retail locations while continuing to specialize in finished steel products
              like rebar and wire rods.
          </p>
          <p>
              They are strongly diversified – with seven deep-water facilities and on
              both coasts and footprints in Hawaii and Puerto Rico.
          </p>
          <p>
          This company’s stock has already DOUBLED over the past year and
              is set to profit greatly from Trump’s new steel and aluminum moves.
          </p>
          <p>
              These 3 are just a short summary of advanced opportunities to rack up an
              extra 12 more “Trump Bonus Checks” per year.
          </p>
          <p>
              That’s an average of receiving a fresh “Trump Bonus Check” in your mailbox,
              every single month!
          </p>
          <p>
              And there’s even more details on this check-producing information waiting

          </p>
          <p>
              Just like when you said yes to an <em>Infinite Income</em> annual
              membership moments ago…
          </p>
          <p>
              Accessing these bonus plays is a no-brainer.

          <p>
              This program ensures your heirs will continue to benefit from your Lifetime
              Plan long after you’re gone.
          </p>
          <p>
              By subscribing to this plan today, you’ll be able to pass your membership
              down to a family member.
          </p>
          <p>
              That way, you keep this program going throughout generations of your
              family, starting with your children, grandchildren or immediate heirs.
          </p>
          <p>
              When it’s time, simply have them dial your lifetime personal liaison up and
              ask for the lifetime plan to be transferred to their name.
          </p>
          <p>
              There are no transfer fees or charges of any type for your heirs.
          </p>
          <p>
              It’s part of our commitment to leaving a legacy for generations to come.
          </p>
          <p>
              Can you imagine? Many decades from now, your grandchildren could still be
              using <em>Infinite Income </em>to boost their wealth and give themselves an
              edge in the world.
          </p>
          <p>
              All because you made a choice to give that to them today.
          </p>
          <p>
              So I hope you understand the true depth of the commitment that I’m making
              here.

          <p>
